# Object Detection using YOLOv8

### About YOLO:

One type of computer vision task is object detection, which involves locating a certain object in images or videos. This is a very important task which has applications in numerous tasks like robotics, self driving cars,  and surveillance. One of the earliest methods used for this task was sliding window technique, R-CNN. YOLO is one such deep learning technique which uses a single-shot to detect object in images. The full form of it is you only look once. It detects objects in single pass and therefore is very useful in real time object detection tasks.YOLO (You Only Look Once) uses an end-to end neural network that makes prediction of object class and the object boundary at once. There are several versions of YOLO with v9 being the latest one. More information on it is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640).
