## üöÄ About Classification and Neural Network:

Classification is a fundamental task in Machine Learning which involves classifying each record to predefined classes or labels using the independent variables. It has a wide range of applications, including image recognition, spam detection, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis.  Neural networks, particularly deep learning models, have transformed classification jobs by automatically learning hierarchical features from data, resulting in extremely accurate and scalable classification solutions across complex and heterogeneous datasets. In this project a Neural Network is built from scratch and used for the task of classification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps:
- Explore the dataset. Normalize the independent variables.
- Split the data into train and test.
- Define the Neural Network - Have used two hidden layer network.
- Train and test the neural network using the train and test split.
- Get the accuracy - Accuracy obtained is Train Accuracy = 78.45% and Validation Accuracy = 75.65%.
- Try different approaches like hyperparameter tuning, learning rate scheduling, early stopping, batch normalization.
